Question: Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?
Answer: The command line is a way to interact with your computer using just plain text. The text that is typed into the command line is called a command. This is simply a different way to use your computer as opposed to using your mouse or keyboard to input commands i.e. get your computer to do things. So you can use the command line to perform tasks, but just by typing the commands in.
Some useful terminal commands explained:
pwd - this shows the "directory" the user is working in i.e. the folder that the terminal commands will apply to
cd - This command changes the directory that the user is working in i.e. going back or double clicking on a folder
mkdir - this Command creates a new directory (folder) within the working directory
touch - this command will create a new file in the given name which will be empty
ls - this command lists what is contained in the working directory i.e. instead of seeing files as icons on the screen, the file name and type is listed in the command line
rm - this command is used to delete a file from the working directory... be careful
exit - fairly straightforward but type this command to exit the terminal/command line
less - this command allows the user to view a file, i.e. if it was a basic text file it would list the text that is contained
rmdir - this will remove a directory or "folder"
mv - this command is used to move a file from one directory(folder) / location to another
